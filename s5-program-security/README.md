# Security Analysis: Insecure Anchor Program

This README highlights the main vulnerabilities found in an insecure Anchor program and provides guidance on how to fix them.

## Identified Vulnerabilities and Fixes

### 1. Authorization Checks
**Issue:** Lack of proper authorization checks.
**Fix:** Implement owner checks and use `Signer<'info>`.

### 2. Arithmetic Operations
**Issue:** Use of basic operators (+=, -=) that can cause overflow/underflow.
**Fix:** Utilize `checked_add` and `checked_sub` to prevent overflow/underflow.

### 3. Account Closure
**Issue:** Accounts are not properly closed.
**Fix:** Properly close accounts using `close = signer`.

### 4. PDA (Program Derived Address) Seeds
**Issue:** Only using ID in seeds, risking collisions.
**Fix:** Include the signer's key in seeds to ensure uniqueness.

### 5. Error Handling
**Issue:** Use of manual checks and `err!`, less robust.
**Fix:** Use `require!` for more robust condition checking.

### 6. Account Structures
**Issue:** Use of `AccountInfo<'info>`, less secure.
**Fix:** Use `Signer<'info>` for validated key checks.
